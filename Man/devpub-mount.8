.SH DESCRIPTION

.B devpub-mount
is a script for mounting external media on NetBSD.  It is
normally invoked by /libexec/devpubd-hooks/03-devpub-mount,
which is run by the devpubd(8) service upon creation of
a new device node such as /dev/sd0.  This typically occurs
when a USB drive is inserted, forexample.

The device name should contain a filesystem recognized
by NetBSD or by fusefs, such as EXFAT, FAT32, FAS16, NTFS,
ISO 9660 (CDs), UDF (DVDs), of FFS (NetBSD native).

The mount point for a device is /media/device-name, e.g.
/dev/sd0e is mounted on /media/sd0e.

The configuration file /usr/pkg/etc can be used to control
ownership and permissions on the mount point, and the program
invoked upon a successful mount.  Defaults are shown below.

MEDIA_MANAGER=/usr/pkg/bin/qmediamanager

The auto-automount-setup(1) script, part of sysutils/auto-admin
will configure a NetBSD system to use devpub-mount.
